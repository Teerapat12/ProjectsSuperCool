This will be a experimental docker project form Leonard and Terrapat.

01. Install docker from https://docs.docker.com/install/ good thing about docker it doesn't matter if you have an mac or an windows operating system.

02. After the you installed docker on your machine, you can already run docker commands "very nice". Mac on the terminal, windows on the power-shell

03. Does Docker really works ? Try "docker --version" or even "docker run -it ubuntu bash" in the second command docker downloads a Ubuntu docker image and logs you in as root you can exit by write "exit"

04. So should we build our own docker image ? hell yeah what about some good old Unix with tools in an docker image
